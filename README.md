ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fuchsm-hdm

Iâ€™m interested in finding out how to use GitHub (on my own).

If you are a student of mine (hi there!) or a potential collaborator and want to reach out, please contact me over my institutional email address (... that you should now how to find ;-) ) as opposed to GitHub channels.
<!---
fuchsm-hdm/fuchsm-hdm is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
